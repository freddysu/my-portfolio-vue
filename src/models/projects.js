Since we have lots of crawlers need to manage, it\'s really inconvenient to do all the operations with shell commands. The purpose of this system is to ease the pain of operating and monitoring crawlers by providing a web UI. Operations include signup, login/logout authentication, connecting to a target server by ssh, creating/removing/listing the crawlers, doing git pull/checkout, etc. The system is implemented by MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, NodeJS).',

Lastly, our system reports the device configuration information and potential vulnerabilities back to the user. The web server, APKs analyser, graph database are implemented by NodeJS, Python and Neo4j respectively.',
